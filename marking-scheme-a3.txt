Total before late penalty: [18/100]
---------------------------------------------------

Nodes join and election is carried out successfully (no unavailability).  [25/25]
  - Clients join sequentially (election in between each join) [15/15]
     Repeat 5 consecutive times:
      - Client joins
      - Wait for leader
      - Check advertisements
  - Clients join concurrently (election in between each batch of joins) [10/10]
     Repeat 5 consecutive times:
      - Multiple clients join concurrently
      - Wait for leader
      - Check advertisements

Nodes fail and an election is carried out successfully (no unavailability).  [15/25]
  - The leader node fails (election for new leader) [15/15]
     Repeat 5 consecutive times:
      - Clients join, leader is elected
      - Leader node is killed (fails)
      - Wait for leader
      - Check advertisements
  - A non-leader node fails (possible election) [0/10]
     Repeat 5 consecutive times:
      - Clients join, a leader is elected
      - A non-leader node is killed (fails)
      - Wait for leader
      - Check advertisements
COMMENTS: no change is detected when non-leader fails

Restarts.  [5/10]
  - A failed node is restarted/rejoins [0/5]
     Repeat 2 consecutive times:
      - Clients join, a leader is elected
      - A non-leader node is killed (fails)
      - Wait for leader
      - Check advertisements
      - The node is restarted and rejoins
      - Wait for leader
      - Check advertisements
  - A failed leader is restarted/rejoins [5/5]
     Repeat 2 consecutive times:
      - Clients join, a leader is elected
      - The leader node is killed (fails)
      - Wait for leader
      - Check advertisements
      - The node is restarted and rejoins
      - Wait for leader
      - Check advertisements
COMMENTS: no change is detected when non-leader fails

Unavailability.  [5/30]
  - 10% unavailability during concurrent node joining [5/15]
  - 10% unavailability when leader fails and election is triggered [0/10]
  - One-off 100% unavailability [0/5]
COMMENTS: nodes could not successfully join group after one-off. >4 nodes 
with 10% unavailability could not print the whole group or keep a leader.

COMMENTS: You should be printing to stdout, not stderr. the built-in print()
prints to stderr. I have taken 10 marks off for this, since I found the error
in your code (it appeared one node was printing, not all of them, which would result
in a much more severe penalty) and changed it.
[ -10 marks ] 

Write-up.  [8/10]


Points lost because you did not run gofmt.  [20/20]
COMMENTS: code appears like it was never gofmt'd
---------------------------------------------------

All solutions must be formatted using gofmt; 20 point penalty for
those that are not properly formatted.
